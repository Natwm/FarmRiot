# Riot Farm

## Overview

**Riot Farm** is a tactical RPG that draws inspiration from classics like *Wakfu* and *Final Fantasy Tactics*, with a narrative twist influenced by George Orwell's *Animal Farm*. Developed using Unreal Engine 4, this game invites players to command a team of animals fighting for the last apple tree. Strategically use height and terrain to outmaneuver and defeat your opponents in this intense battle for control.

## Game Description

  - **Tank**: Absorbs damage and protects allies.
